## Usage Info
To generate a new icon, you will need a Google Account. Click the Sign in with Google button in the Header, then select your account. Then, navigate to the `/create` URL in the header, and select your prompt, color and art style. After clicking generate, your icon will be created in the background. Once done, you can download the icon, and view all your previously created icons at `/icons`.
